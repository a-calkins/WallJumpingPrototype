# Wall Jumping Prototype
A basic, rough prototype of the movement in PlatformerN, focusing mainly on interactions with walls (sliding, jumping).


A to move left, D to move right, space to jump.
When touching a wall, the player will slide. While sliding, the player can perform a jump by pressing space, and jump in different directions by pressing A or D.
